% \begin{theorem}[There are Infinite Primes]
%     Let $P$ be the set of all prime numbers. $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$, $|P|>n$.
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%     Suppose that there were a finite number of primes such that $|P|=n$. Consider the product of all prime numbers
%     \begin{equation}
%         k = p_1p_2p_3\ldots p_n.
%     \end{equation}
%     Clearly $k$ is divisible by all prime numbers. Now consider the number $k+1$. Since $k$ is divisible by all primes, $k+1$ cannot be divisible by any primes, which means that $k+1$ is prime. However $k+1$ is not in our set $P$, which contradicts our claim that $P$ contained all primes. $\therefore$ there must be infinite number of primes.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\approx$ be an equivalence relation on a finite set A. Suppose that \\
  \begin{equation}
    f : A/ \approx\rightarrow A
  \end{equation}
  is a bijective function. Find and prove what $\approx$ is.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}Suppose we have $f^{-1}$ and are assigning pigeons to boxes.\\
Pigeons = $A$ ; Boxes = $A/\approx$\\
Since $f$ is a bijection, also $f^{-1}$ is.\\
So $f^{-1}$ assigns pigeons to boxes, and there must be at least as many boxes as there are pigeons.\\
So, $\approx$ must be equal or else there will be fewer boxes than pigeons.\\

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$ be a finite set and $f : A \rightarrow A$. Define the sequence 
  \begin{equation}
    x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3 \ldots
  \end{equation}
  to be
  \begin{equation}
    x_0 \in A, x_{n+1} = f(x_n).
  \end{equation}
  There exists a value of N such that if $n > N$ then $x_n$ is guaranteed to be inside of an infinitely repeating cycle of the sequence.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since A is finite, $x_{N} = x_n$ for some n and N.\\
$x_{N+j} = x_{n+j}$ for all j and for some k, N= n+k.\\
Using induction, we can show that $x_{n+j} = x_{N+j} = x_{N+j+k} = x_{N+j+2k} = x_{N+j+3k} = \ldots$\\
Base Case: $x_{N+j} = x_{n+j+k}$\\
Inductive Case: $x_{n+j} = x_{n+j+mk}$
\end{proof}
